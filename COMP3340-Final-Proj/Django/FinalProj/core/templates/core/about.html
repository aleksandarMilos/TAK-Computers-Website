            We have developed an inventory management website to meet the fast-growing demands from customers.
            This system allows us to add and categorize products for sale and browse products based 
            on category. Each product has a description with a price, and upon selecting a particular product to view,
            the website will also show you similar products. Products can be added and removed with ease,
            making this an efficient yet easy to use website for inventory management.
